# GitHub Action - Issue Label Notifications
This GitHub Action allows you to notify users or teams when specific labels are added to an issue. It runs every time a label is attached to an issue, and compares the label to the list of notification recipients that you specify. If a match is found, the action will add a comment to the issue and @mention the notification recipients.

## Usage
### Pre-requisites
Create a workflow `.yml` file in your repositories `.github/workflows` directory. An [example workflow](#example-workflow) is available below. For more information, reference the GitHub Help Documentation for [Creating a workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).

### Inputs
- `recipients`: A map of labels and which individuals or teams to notify. Multiple labels can be configured by putting each on a newline. Multiple teams and/or individuals can be configured for each label by putting a space between them.
- `message`: (Optional) The message to include in the comment. Must include at least `{recipients}` but can also include `{label}`. See the default message in the action.yml file.
